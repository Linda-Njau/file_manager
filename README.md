This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

- User authentication via a token
- List all files
- Upload a new file
- Change permission of a file
- View a file
- Generate thumbnails for images


The codebase will explore the following concepts:
- how to create an API with Expressa
- how to authenticate a user
- how to store data in MongoDB
- how to store temporary data in Redis
- how to setup and use a background worker
